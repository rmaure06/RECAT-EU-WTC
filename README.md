## RECAT-EU Wake turbulence category for Euroscope

This small plugin registers a tag item containing the WTC of the aircraft based on the RECAT-EU Wake turbulence categories (see file:///C:/Users/rmaur/Downloads/eurocontrol-recat-eu-edition-2-0-1.pdf for more info)

It registers two tag items to replace the default Euroscope ones:

# Important remarks
- /!\ Be advised the color of the item is hardcoded to orange, but the code is very short and simple so it can be easily edited
- The code database is also hardcoded but covers nearly all the aircraft types that are flown on VATSIM, please create an issue if you find unsupported types (showing as "?")
